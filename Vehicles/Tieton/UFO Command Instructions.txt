This UFO craft is a real handy tool for exploring, it has a script that is as easy to use as flying, plus it has a few more options, like"cruise on/off" and variable speeds, like 10 settings, plus "slow"  If you want to go fast, you can select "warp"  In future versions I plan to have "warp 1-3" but first there is a sim boundry crash I need to work on, so for now, you will just have "warp".

The command list is at the bottom of this note, but first lets look at your graphic settings.  The biggest problem you will have with this craft is loading in all the information that comes at you as you travel through the sims, I mean it all tries to load in at one time, and by the time it loads in, you are already through the area, and unfortunately, you have either crashed, or totally missed the view.  Your bandwidth is very important here, but more than that, your texture cache and detail settings are more so.  The following is a list of settings I have found that work absolutely perfect on both my computers.  You may want to at least try them if you have loading problems.  I mean if it takes more than 5 seconds on average to rez when you teleport, you should look at your settings.:

( from SL  Forum, search word "drop distance")

Graphics;
Anistropic Filtering : off
Local Light : off [this hit you bigtime in game, few use it]
Shadows : off [leads to crashes when you enable this lately]
Disable Far Clip : off
Shiny Objects : off [you miss out on alot without this in SL -.-] --  I leave it on.

Avatar Rendering;
Normal
Terrain Detail; None

Rest doesnt really matter much.

Adv.Graphics
Agp ; on/off [doesnt matter no speed gain]
Texture Cache ; small [512 mb ram]
Video Card Memory ; should be what your video card has.
Object Detail ; Dont go to low everything looks like blocks ^^; try out some settings.
Tree Detail ; lowest
Avatar Detail ; lowest

Avatar Vertex Program ; play with it, on/off, guessing you need to have it off

Draw Distance ; 64
Fog Distance ; well I dont like fog so mine is 4 , 0.5 = loads of fog, 4 = no fog
Drop draw distance ; ? not to sure i use 0 , i guess 5?
Bumpiness draw distance ; 0
Max Particle count ; youd be better off disabling it, that one can really hurt you, I have mine set to 256, works ok there. If dont have a good video card , set it to 0.
Outfit composite limit ; I still dont get what this does, mines 50 no diffrence then at 0, so 0 .  Works at 50 too.

You can list these commands by typing "/6 menu" anytime, without the quotes of course.  Also you can change the "/6" to any channel you want to use,  by editing the script.  Set the global variable CHANNEL to whatever integer you desire.  I set it to "/6" because I have nothing else on that channel, plus it prevents a lot of spam on the local chat channel.  One other hint, if you edit the target interval on the "warp" command, try not to go above 20, it could cause irregular behavior when you cross over sim boundries.  You will really be moving!  So be careful where you travel.  Try not to bump into objects, remember in most sims the ceiling height for objects is 768 meters, so if you need to go long distances across sims, try to be at least 1000 meters high. You can also go off world if you go to high, usually above 4000 meters, in which case your ship will disappear and you will fall to the ground, You may want to get an emergency parachutte for just such occurances, they are available here:

Info on cloaking:

The newest upgrades since UFO ver.1,6C have 2 new commands, "cloak" and "decloak"

cloak, turns the craft invisible and sets phantom mode, you can walk right through it,

decloak, restores craft to normal beautiful self.

I didn't set these commands to any channel, so don't use the /CHANNEL switch to issue them,  The /CHANNEL switch only works when the craft is activated, cloak and decloak work any time, so now you can park it on your property and nobody will know it's there.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

With UfO Version 4.2 and Later the content folder contains a complete collection of command control gestures for all of Mark Coffee UFO crafts and airplanes.  they are also available in click boxes around the store and they come complete with comprehensive instructions.

Hatch:

The Hatch opens and closes by pressing the Yellow button on the back of the UFO.

Speed:

This UFO will travel at speeds up to Warp3, but I do not recommend using that speed all the time, it tops out at over 100 knots and is quite reckless, you will certainly run into objects and probably crash going into slow or crowded sims, so slow down when crossing sim boundries.

Cloaking:

This UFO now will cloak everyone inside the craft when the cloak is engaged, however high prim hairdos -- jewelry -- prim shoes and some hats will not cloak, so if you want to be completely invisible remove those objects before you cloak.

Happy flying.
