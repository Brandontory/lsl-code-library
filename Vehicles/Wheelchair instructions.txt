How to use the wheelchair
================
August 06, 2004

*****
HOW TO USE:
To use the wheelchair, drag it from your inventory onto your avatar. 

If your avatar stands up, click the chair to trigger the sit animation again.
*****

The wheelchair is an attachment. This ensures that it can go with you through teleport. The sit animation will start as soon as it's attached.


NOTE: Because Second Life doesn't recognize the presence of a wheelchair, you will be able to "sit" on objects as if the chair wasn't there, which interferes with the "sit" animation. If your avatar stands up, click the chair to trigger the sit animation again.

Please distribute this chair for free and make derivative works. 
IT IS NOT FOR RESALE EVER.

Please direct any questions to Cubey Terra.
