Welcome to your first shuttle in SL!

It's kinda Star Trek :-)

To use it - right click and select 'Board'

To start say 'Start' in chat. To Stop say 'Stop'.

You fly using Forward Back Left and Right and Up and Down just like moving your AV.

If you click the 'Saggitarius' panel at the front you can select how transparent you want the windows to be.

Have fun and remember to tidy up after yourself!
