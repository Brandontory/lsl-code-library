thankyou for your continued interest in this product.
to use this updater, merely place it in the root prim of your old DC-17m Blastech holster. 
(note, holster, as the holster should be moddable)
it will automatically inform you of your updates progress.

if you have any problems getting this script to work, please send a notecard to me (my messages often cap and so messages may be lost)
I released the old version a long time ago, please do not be offended if I ask for proof of ownership.
