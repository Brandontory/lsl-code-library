     The L86A2 LSW (Light Support Weapon) is another weapon in the SA80 family. It has a longer, heavier barrel, an extra pistol grip and a bipod, providing greater long range firepower and accuracy compared to the SA80 rifle. In fact the LSW has excellent accuracy comparable to that of a sniper rifle. All weapons within the SA80 family are 5.56 mm NATO calibre and like the SA80 rifle it is fed by a 30 round magazine. The LSW is now known as the DMR ( Designated Marksmen Rifle ).

           This peticular L86A2 has been modifyed by Blade Syakumi from the SLLF standerd issue L85A2, just like the Real Life version. The commands are basic and the same as all the weapons within SLLF.
