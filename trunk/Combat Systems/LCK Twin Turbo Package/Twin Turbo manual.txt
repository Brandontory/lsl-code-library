About LCK 2 Twin Turbo.

Started by Hanumi Takakura and now developed by Salene Lusch, as both a help for the comunity and learning experience. Made using Jora Welessa's LCK 2.0 opensource and released as such. Twin Turbo itself is not for sale. It is to be redistributed with all it's components and Notecards. If you see lightsabers sold with twin Turbo, know that only the lightsaber hilt is being sold. Also note that I, Hanumi Takakura, didn't make all of the hilts out there that use Twin Turbo or earlier versions. If you need help, contact the seller of the specific hilt.

Thanks to everyone who support Turbo and opensource LCK kits.
As of version 1.94 Salene Lush is the sole developer. I, Hanumi takakura, hereby pass the mantle on Twin Turbo to her, and thank her for her deep interest.

**Controlling your saber**--------------------------------------------
Wear the HUD if you want, and at least the main saber. In the HUD, press the bit TT button if you don't see any other buttons. In the line of 4 second biggest buttons, press the leftmost one to turn on your right hand saber. If you don't use the HUD, then say in chat, /99 on. To turn off, say /99 off.

To use the attack animations, or plainly attack, hold your left mouse button and press the movement keys (arrows or w,a,s,d).

To use saber throw, just say /99saberthrow. While the saber is away, you won't be able to perform attack animations. Try to not move too fast for a realistic saber catching effect. If the saber doesn't return to you, it will still dissapear after around two seconds. If after this time you don't have your saber back in your hands, even if it comes back to you, say /99saberback, and the saber will be in your hands again.

Commands

Shoto saber is the name used for a small, almost knife size blade in some sabers. To make one of your blades a shoto, say /99shoto1 for the main blade and /99shoto2 for a secondary blade or /99shoto for both. Say /99standard2 to return the blades to their original sizes.

Instructions to set your custom hilts:
The package contains various items for hilts. 
   * main              ---> the main script, only one is required.
   * secondary    ---> shall be used for any extra blades (like duals and doubles)
   * off primary   ---> containt a script the main blade hip version
   * off offhand ---> containt a script the offhand blade hip version

**Setting it all up**--------------------------------------------
First. You need to make or have a hilt of your choice that lets you modify it at a minimun. Copy is needed to of course have something to act as hip hilt. You need at least two copies of your hilt for full kit usage. One for the main saber, one for the hip hitl. Two more for offhand saber and hip hilts. This is purely fashion though. LCK Twin Turbo can be used right out of the box just by wearing the saber items. But you will look bad with a single prim hilt.

To start, Rez the Twin Turbo items on the ground and rez copies of your hilts, always keeping one as backup in your inventory. If not in a place where scripts are disallowed, the Calibrators will show up and position themselves straight up. If you can't see the calibrators when you rez the objects, press ctrl+alt+T or wear the hud and press the calibrator button to show them.  You can also just turn it all on and get a script error. This error is normal if you turn any lightsaber in the ground and not worn. Don't panic.

 This next step is very important. Align the hilt with the proper lck item, making sure the blade is pointing in the proper way, then link a copy of the hilt in each calibrator you want to use. 
 
 To link Turbo properly, make sure the "edit linked parts" box in the edit window is --->unchecked<---. Then, select the hilt first, hold your ctrl key, and lastly, select the LCK Turbo item to make it the parent prim.  Hit ctrl + L to link both objects. If everything went right, the name of the whole object will be the name of the Twin Turbo item you used. Change the name to the hilt's name or whatever, to easily tell what object is the completed saber.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The parent prim is the prim that will have control over all the other prims in a link. In an object, you can see which is the parent prim by noticing the yellow outlined prim in the object. All the other prims are blue outlined. If you don't link Twin Turbo in the proper way, every time you turn on your saber, it will ask you for animation permissions.
 
 Wear each on its respective place. Main saber on right hand, offhand for left hand, main hip hilt on left hip and offhand hip hilt on right hip. 
 
 To make the doublesaber work, link the main saber to a doublesaber blade, always selecting the main saber last so it remains the parent prim. The double back part won't work by itself. In the double back object, you will notice the prim has a green end and a red end. The green end shows where the blade will come from while the red end points towards the main saber.

**To add your hilt to the saber throw**--------------------------------------------

The saber throw is linkable like the rest of the LCK, with a little twist. You will want to make a sort of knock off, or very low prim version of your hilt to link to this. Maybe 3 or four prims could do good.  As a physical object, the saber throw acts exactly as a bullet, and also it has a 31 prim link limitation. This means you can't use a 70 prim saber as a saber throw.

The first you will want to do with the object is set the script inside the saber throw object to non active. For that, attach the saber throw and edit the object, opening the script and unckecking the "Running" box. This will prevent the script from making the object dissapear when you rez it. Another thing you can do is to rez the saber throw item in land you don't own and where scripts are disabled. Some sandboxes are like this.

Next, if you atached the item, detach it, rez it on the ground and in the edit options, search and uncheck the "Physical" and "Temporary" boxes to prevent the object from moving and dissapearing. Now you can freely edit the prim. Link the lower prim hilt you make or get while keeping the saber throw object as parent prim. 

Now, you can re-check the Physical and Temporary boxes and pick up the item.

Lastly, re-wear the saber throw, and edit to reactivate the script you turned off when you started. And finally, edit your saber again and delete or rename the copy on it and replace it with yours. 

HUD

The HUD can be attached on any hud slot.

The four buttons of the first row have the following functions:
   sabers off
   main blade on
   all blades on
   tools
   
The tools buttons opens and close an extras menu 
The 3 first tools lines allow to change the colours of the blades, left is for the main blade and right for secondary.
The next line change the size (standart or shoto)
and the 2 last lines with roman numbers change the styles (per default a mixup of "basic" and "strong")

The numbered buttons are the styles you currently have. LCK 2 Twin Turbo comes with basic and strong as default. In a brand new saber, all buttons will have either basic or stong as styles. 

To add styles, right click anywhere in the HUD and select edit from the pie menu, on the tools tab that appears, press the blue "more" button and on the tabs that appear below, press contents. There's a notecard called STYLES. Open it and on the next empty style number, type the name of the form you are adding.
EX: style1=form_1

The buttons are small to give space while still having the HUD open. With basic building skills, you can resize them to your liking. Also, most of the buttons will say their function as chat when pressed.
