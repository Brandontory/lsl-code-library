# The first line shows the names of the bomb types.  Note that a bomb won't be considered an VICE weapon unless the first 4 characters in the name are "VICE", followed by " CMB", " SMB"," MDB", " LGB", or " TRP", based on the type of bomb it is.
# The second line shows the rez offset of the bomb, relative to the root prim.  The best values depend on the airplane's geometry, but any offset of distance >10m will silently fail.
# The third line corresponds to the local rotation to rez the bomb at, relative to the airplane. Angles are expressed in quaternions, so <0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0> corresponds to "zero rotation".
# The fourth line corresponds to the velocity at which the bomb is rezzed, in relation to the rezzer's velocity and rotation.  For the infantry-type small bomb rezzer, the maximum offset velocity is 12m/s.

# If you want to create your own bombs, simply add their information to the 4 comma-separated lists in the first 4 lines of this notecard.
