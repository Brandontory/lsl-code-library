Hello,
   Thank you for your interest in acquiring a custom designed lightsaber. Although it's not required, some information is useful in creating your one of a kind hilt. I work with you on every idea and try to put forward some of my own for you to consider. You have my solemn guarantee that I will not resell your custom hilt to anyone, and I always keep a backup "just in case". I have several lightsaber scripts I can incorporate into your hilt to include the LCK 2.1b20 scripts, LCK Twin turbo 1.97 scripts, and the LCK Advanced II scripts. Please remember that you are not paying for these scripts and they are installed free of charge, you are just paying for my time and effort I put into the hilt I design. Most custom hilts I charge only 250L, however if you want me to create custom textures, the cost increases for each texture upload (10L). I look forward to designing your hilt, please feel free to IM me or drop me a notecard if you are interested in buying a custom lightsaber hilt from me.

Sincerely
Millenia Infinity
CEO of Skunk Werks
