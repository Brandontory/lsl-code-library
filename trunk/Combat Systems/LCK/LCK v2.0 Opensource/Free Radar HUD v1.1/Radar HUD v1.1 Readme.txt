POSITIONING YOUR HUD

If you would rather attach the HUD to a different part of your screen then you can do that as follows. Detach the HUD if you're currently using it. Right-click on "Radar HUD" in your inventory and select "Attach To HUD" followed by the corner you prefer.

After attaching a HUD to a different area of your screen you may find that the HUD disappears from view. If this happens you can use the following general technique. Please be advised though that you're on your own here. I can't offer assistance here for reasons of practicality and time.  It's a fiddly process but once you have mastered it you can use this technique with all your other HUDs.

1) Firstly ensure you have access to any HUD on screen (doesnt even have to be this tool). If you don't see any other HUDs on screen then attach one from your inventory. If you don't have any other HUDS in your inventory then simply use a regular prim as a HUD as follows: Rez a new prim on the ground, hit ESC key to exit edit mode, right-click the prim, select "Attach HUD" then "Centre" - You should now see that prim fixed to the centre of your screen (later on simply right-click it and select "Detach" when you're finished).

2) Right-click any HUD and select "Edit". This will put you in HUD edit mode.

3) Zoom out. You should be able to use your mouse scrollwheel to do this.

4) Everything will appear smaller now. The white square represents the edge of the screen. And you should see the Radar HUD tool now.

5) Left-click the Radar HUD tool.

6) You will find that the zoom level springs back to normal. But the Radar HUD tool is still selected even though you can't see it.

7) Now zoom back out again.

8) Reposition the tool so that it's within the white square.

9) Hit the ESC key to reset the zoom level. Your tool should be within view. You can make further alterations to the position now.
