Hud: 
The Meter and Hud are free and can be found in a dispenser in the TP in point.  This is a new Unified Meter Architecture system that works with all mechs.  The Meter will detech which mech you have on and adjust itself accordingly.  To operate
1.  Attatch your mech
2.  Attach weapons and accessories
3.  Attatch Meter and Hud
4.  Click on the chest of your mech. (Follow the instructions on the pop up text on your Chest)

When you fall in battle type /1 reset.  A bubble appears around you, and you cannot take damage at that time.
When you are in your bubble make your way to the safe zone.  Once your bubble expires you have 1 hit point, and must click your chest to set up your mech.
If you are damaged when you are in set up mode you will be destroyed but it does not count as a kill or against you.
Please make sure you are in the safe zone.

How To: 
The BattleTech Combat system is a fully closed system this ensures fairness and fun. To use the items you just purchased, simply attach them to your avatar. The meter will activate once you have it attached and there is only 1 main command to reset the mech: /1 reset. Each Mech has hard points to attach weapon or other items. You cannot attach items to any other place other then these hardpoints (This is enforced via scripts to keep players from over-loading a mech with weapons and making the system unbalanced. Much effort was taken to ensure fair play and zero ability to cheat.  

Each mech has 5 hardpoints they are as follows;

(1)  = Right Upper Arm
(2)  = Left Upper Arm
(3)  = Right Shoulder                                                              
(4) = Left Shoulder                          
(5) = Spine    
 
                 _3 ____  4_
                /     \  5  /      \
             1         \_/         2
                         ==
                      /        \ 
                     |           | 
                   =           =
                   
Depending on the class of your mech you will be able to attach weapons to these locations and customize the layout of your mech (some weapons cannot be used with some mechs, for example, a weapon classed as "Heavy" CAN NOT be used with a "Light" mech chassy. This is enforced via scripts as well). Once you have your mech armed with weapons you can use the following commands to activate your weapons. 

/1 arm rarm = activates the weapon attached to the right arm or hardpoint (1).
/1 arm larm = activates the weapon attached to the left arm or hardpoint (2).
/1 arm rshoulder = activates the weapon attached to the right shoulder or hardpoint (3).
/1 arm lshoulder = activates the weapon attached to the left shoulder or hardpoint (4).
/1 arm spine = activates the weapon attached to the spine or hardpoint (5).

Alternatively, you can use the buttons on the hud or the included gestures to activate your weapons. (Gestures function on F2-F6 when active).

Combat: 

Combat is pretty straight-forward, clicking the mouse when you have a weapon active will fire the weapon (in mouse look or in 3rd-person view).  Each weapon will generate heat. Too much heat and you will shut down so pay attention to the warnings. If you over-heat you will be stuck in shutdown mode until you cool down below 90. Once that happens you will be powered up again (this is all controlled by the combat system). If you seem to be over heating a lot you may want to invest in a heatsink or coolant system for the mech (purchased seperately).

Each mech is classed which determines its armor rating. 
Heavy Mech = 300 
Medium Mech = 200
Light Mech = 100
Ultra Light = 50
There are a number of Attack Mechs or Omni Mechs which have in between armor ratings.

Once all your armor has been depleted you mech will be destroyed. This will update the main score board in the Main terminal reflecting your record. To reset the mech type /1 reset. DO NOT RESET YOUR MECH IN COMBAT OR YOU WILL BE DISQUALIFIED AND YOUR RECORD WILL LOSE 1 POINT.
