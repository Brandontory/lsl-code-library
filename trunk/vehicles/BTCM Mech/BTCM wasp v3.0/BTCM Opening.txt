I'm Proud to announce the opening of the BattleTech Combat and RP sim. This sim is loosely based around the BattleTech universe and features one of the most well developed combat systems ever used in SL. BTCM 2.0 was hand crafted to focus on good low-lag mecha combat and has a ton of features. Everything you would find in the classic Battletech games has been faithfully reproduced in SL. Heat Management, Limited Ammunition, Jump Jets, A Slew of 20+ weapon types, 7 Battle Mechs so far and many more coming. Everything is open now and ready to be enjoyed. We will be hosting an event November 12th starting @ 5pm SL time. We are also giving credits to those who wish to set up clans on the sim. We will be hosting weekly tournaments for Lindens as well. 

If your curious check out youtube video to see the mechs in action.
