Highly detailed and having ALOT of time put into this vehicle, this Humvee has been one of my most detailed vehicles. It has real sounds and is almost an exact replica of the real vehicle.

It has a Mk. 19 Grenade launcher on the roof, that works and allows anyone to use, but since I have no good scripts, it doesnt have a passenger eject system script.

Even though while wearing the 3 peices (i know some people hate wearing cars, but if any of you find a better way to have a working car with this many prims, please tell me) and over 700 prims, the Humvee doesnt lag for me at all (if it does for you, your comp blows)


The Doors and Launcher attaches to your stomach: 255 prims

The Chassis attaches to your pelvis: 244 prims

The Body attaches to your spine: 143 prims

Hope you will enjoy this. Free updates as always.
