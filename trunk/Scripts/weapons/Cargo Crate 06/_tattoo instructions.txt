This pack contains 8 tattoo designs- each  in a variety of upper body positions.

A quick photo reference of the designs can be found in the 'tattoo photo guide' included in this pack.

How to wear your new tattoos:

Because each of these tattoos is in raw texture format, they can be worn a number of ways, and in a number of combinations...

1) As Clothing-

     Select: Edit > Appearance >
        
       then choose Undershirt, Shirt, Jacket
       or Gloves
       
       Click on "Fabric" (for jackets, "Upper")
       then select the tattoo you'd like to wear.
       
Make sure the clothing layer you choose is over an area of exposed skin  ( i.e.: if you wear a center back tattoo as a jacket, your shirt and undershirt should be showing skin in that area...)

Some tattoos made for the arms can also be worn as gloves, as indicated by  name.

2) As Skin:

     Select: Edit > Appearance > Skin
     
     Click on "Upper Tattoo" then select your 
     tattoo.

Play around with layers and combinations until you find the body art that's right for you...
I hope you enjoy them.
