INSTRUCTIONS:

Once you've programmed the script, this notecard doesn't need to be used on it again, and can be removed, or you can even copy the script you've programmed and use it as many times as you need without reprogramming it. Below are what the configuration options mean and how to use them:

Type - Valid Types are "fog", "smoke", "mist", "directional", and "cigarette". They will cause the script to behave as the type name suggests.

Texture - Valid textures are "fog", "smoke", "smolder", "mist", "tire burn", and "default". Aside from the obvious ones, "smolder" was designed to work specifically with the cigarette type. "tire burn" is a hard one to use realistically, but there are set-ups which can do interesting things whith this texture. "default" is SL's default particle texture-Pretty much any effect you use this with will be generic, but you may find use for it.

Start and End Colors - Enter these as vectors. Think of a vector as <Red,Green,Blue> percentages. 1.0 would be 100%. 0.02 would be 2% and so on. Here are some examples:
<0,0,0> = Black (0% Red, 0% Green, 0% Blue)
<1,1,1> = White (100% Red, 100% Green, 100% Blue)
<1,0,0> = Red (100% Red, 0% Green, 0% Blue)
<0,1,0> = Green (0% Red, 100% Green, 0% Blue)
<0,0,1> = Blue (0% Red, 0% Green, 100% Blue)
<1,0,1> = Purple (100% Red, 0% Green, 100% Blue)
<0.5, 0.0, 0.5> = Dark Purple (50% Red, 0% Green, 50% Blue)
Don't think of these numbers as having to add up to 100%. That will just confuse us both and cause the world to end suddenly and violently. White or lighter shades of grey work best for most fog and smoke set-ups.

Start and End Sizes - This is the size of the particles themselves in meters. Anything from 0.003 to 4.0 is all good.

Visibility - Use 0 - 100. This is the percentage for the effect being seen. The lower the number, the more transparent the effect. (100 means 100% visible)

Creation Rate - Valid range is between 0.01 - Infinity. This is the amount of time in between creating new elements, in seconds. 0.2 is generally a good amount. 

Particle Life - Anything bwteen 0 - 90. This is how long in seconds the elements remain in existence before expiring.

Command Channel - This is the channel on which the script will listen for on/off commands. 0 is open chat. It will only listen to the current owner of the script/item the script is in.

Command Word - This is the word that will be acknowledged for verbal commands. Say for instance the Command Word is "dog shit". This means you would type "dog shit on" to turn on the Fog Master. If you also set Command Channel to "2", you'd type "/2 dog shit on" to turn on the Fog Master.

Script Channel - This is the channel on which it will listen to other scripts. The scripts must have the same owner as the light script. (Don't worry about using this option unless you intend to use other scripts to manipulate this one - More info on this in main instructions)

Script Word - This defines the protocol used for the Fog Master being commanded by another script. The usefulness of this is changing this word to make your Fog Master also respond to a control module for Outy's Fire and Light Scripts, or other Outy packages, so two effects can be activated at once if your object also uses other Outy Creator Packages. More details on this in the main instructions.

Custom Texture - If you want to use your own custom texture, paste a texture key(UUID) on this line. It would look something like this: 
"Custom Texture|0x0X0x0X-0x0X-0x0X-0x0X-0x0X0x0X0x0X" Once a valid key is set, it will override the current texture, so there's no need to mess with that. If you're not using this feature, leave it as is, or leave it blank.

Use SL Wind? - Enter either "yes" or "no" here. If this line is set to "yes", the effect will respond to SL's dynamic wind information.
