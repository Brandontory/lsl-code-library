YASS - Yet Another Sim Scanner


This sim scanner scanns a sim in it's normal
range, that is the area 256m x 256m up to
a height of 768m.

Scanner spheres and target displays are
temp on rez, so, that the ambulant version
just uses one prim which counts agains
your parcel. The stationary version uses
3 prims.

The whole YASS is once again available

Please read the license file, thats part of
