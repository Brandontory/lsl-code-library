The Concept
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The combination of color and time leads to the color-time-circle. The color-time-circle represents the course of the day by light and color degrees. The day has twelve hours and each hour is assigned a special color. The brightest color, yellow, is 12 noon, when the sun is at its zenith.

Timecode for the hour slices:

12:00 yellow
01:00 orange
02:00 pink
03:00 red
04:00 lilac
05:00 violet
06:00 blue
07:00 green
08:00 turquoise
09:00 brown
10:00 ochre
11:00 beige

How to Read the Clock?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On a chronometer time is shown by hands and numerals. Differently on a Chromachron, the color-time-watch: Its face is not a dial but a color-time-circle, over which a black disk revolves with a piece cut out as large as a color segment. The disk revolves with the speed of one color area per hour. The disk cut-out indicates the time.

If, for example, this stands on yellow, it is 12:00 noon. The more to be seen of the following color, the nearer the next hour. More time reading examples:

12:00 means yellow
12:30 means half orange
12:45 means 1/4 to orange


History
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1971, Tian Harlan, architect, engineer and artist, developed the communication system "Chromachron" (Chroma=Color and Chronos=Time) that, as was his hope, visualizes time with less rigidity. A rotating disk with a pie-shaped cutout revolves over a colored time zone (each color represents an hour) to approximate time, gauging rotation by fluid motion without demarcation of minutes or seconds. Pieter Doensen describes the Chromachron in his book Watch: History of the Modern Wristwatch as the "anti-stress watch," freeing us from the "dictatorship of exact time." Originally conceived as the "Colour-Time" clock sculpture at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, Tian created over 100 variants of the watch (and clocks) through the eighties.

How do i set the correct timezone?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thats a bit tricky. You need to change the script in the black disk. That means, you right-click the object and select edit in the pie menu. Check the 'Edit linked parts' checkbox, left-click the black disk, open the script 'Disk Mover' in the 'Content' tab.

Just uncomment (delete the '//') the line start representing your timezone and comment (add the '//') on the line start of all other timezones.

After you made all desired changes press the 'Save' button.

Please note, this time zones dont show summertime regulations.  You need to adjust to your local summertime manualy, this is normaly done by selecting the next line. Do not forget to set the normal time  back when summertime is over!!

The default timezone is set to UTC, Greenwich Mean Time.
