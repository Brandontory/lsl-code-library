ZHAO-II : Ziggy's (new) HUD Animation Overrider

==========
If you need help
==========

If you bought this Animation Overrider (AO) pre-loaded with animations, and you need help with the animations, please do not IM Ziggy Puff with questions. I (Ziggy) only make the AO (which is a free product), I do not make or sell any animations. The AO is a separate product from the animations that are contained within it. Some animation creators use my AO to package and sell their animations. That's why it shows me as the creator of the AO.

If you need help with the animations, you need to contact the person you bought the ZHAO-II from. To find out who to contact, try the following:

* Right click on the AO and select 'Edit'. Click on 'More', go to the 'Contents' tab, right-click on an animation and select 'Properties'. That will tell you who created the animations you bought.

* If you bought the AO recently, check your account history. Click on the 'World' menu at the top of your screen, and select 'Account History' to be taken to your Second Life account web page.

* If you remember the store you bought it from, go back there and see who owns the vendor that you got the AO from.


If you need help with the AO functions, read on. You can also join the 'ZHAO Help' group and ask questions there.

How To Use
=======

If you bought the ZHAO-II pre-loaded with animations, then it's already been configured by the person who set it up. To use it:

* Right-click the ZHAO-II in your inventory and select 'Wear'. It should attach itself to some point on your HUD (default is bottom right)
* The 'Power' button turns ZHAO-II on and off. Green means on, gray means off. When ZHAO-II is off, it won't override your animations
* The 'Menu' button lets you customize the behavior of your ZHAO-II. The options are:

Help: Gives you this notecard

Reset: Resets the scripts

Load: Lets you load an animation config notecard. You need to load a notecard after you make changes to it. You can use this to set up multiple animation 'sets' in different notecards, and switch between them

Settings: Displays the current settings 

Next Stand: Cycles to the next 'Standing' animation, or a random 'Standing' animation, based on random/sequential setting (see below). On the random setting, this may end up choosing the same 'Standing' animation that's currently playing

Sit On/Off: Selects whether the 'Sitting' animation is played when you sit on an object. Turn this off for vehicles, poseballs, and so on

Rand/Seq: Selects whether 'Standing' animations are cycled randomly or sequentially (in the order specified in the config notecard) 

Stand Time: Lets you change the time between auto-cycling 'Standing' animations. 0 turns off stand auto-cycling

Walks: Lets you choose a 'Walking' animation (if the AO has been set up with multiple choices for this animation)

Sits: Same as above, for 'Sitting' animations

Ground Sits: Same as above, for 'Sitting On Ground' animations

============
Setup Instructions
============

This section tells you how to add/change animations. Note that the notecards from the old ZHAO won't work with ZHAO-II. If you have an old ZHAO and you want to switch to ZHAO-II, you need a new notecard. If you don't want to re-write a notecard by hand, rez the provided 'Notecard Converter' object and follow its instructions.

This will only work if the ZHAO-II you have is modifiable. If you bought a ZHAO-II from someone that's pre-packaged with animations and they removed modify permissions, I cannot help you with that. You could try picking up a free empty ZHAO-II from my store and moving your animations/notecards (beware of SL inventory bugs). So, assuming you have modify permissions on your ZHAO-II...

1. If you are wearing the ZHAO-II, detach it.

2. Find the ZHAO-II in your inventory. If you have multiple ZHAO-IIs, find the right one that you want to edit.

3. Make sure you're on land where you can rez objects, and the auto return is several minutes long. If you're not sure, go to a sandbox.

3. Press Ctrl-3 to bring up the edit window.

4. Drag the ZHAO onto the ground. It should be highlighted for edit.

5. On the Edit window, click the 'More' button, then the 'Content' tab. You are now viewing the content's of the ZHAO-II's inventory. If you have a lot of animations in the ZHAO-II's inventory, wait a while for this window to finish refreshing.

6. Drag the animation(s) you want to add, from your own inventory, into the ZHAO-II's inventory. Wait for the to animations show up in the ZHAO-II's inventory. If you take the ZHAO-II back into your inventory too soon, you may lose animations due to SL inventory issues.

7. If you bought the ZHAO-II already pre-loaded with animations, it should have a notecard in it that's already set up. I can't tell you what this notecard will be called, but it should be easy to find. Find this notecard you want to edit, and drag it from the ZHAO-II's inventory into your inventory. 

8. If you bought an empty ZHAO-II from my store, it should have a notecard called 'Default'. Copy the 'Default' notecard into your inventory.

8. In your inventory, rename this notecard. Call it "My Anims" or something like that. Keep the name small, it needs to fit on a dialog menu button.

9. Open up the notecard. You'll see  lines in it that look like the following:

[ Walking ]
[ Sitting ]

... and so on. If the notecard was already set up with animations, the lines will look like this:

[ Walking ]MaleWalk1|MaleWalk2|DorkyWalk1
[ Sitting ]CrossLeggedSit|MaleSit1

10. Find the line that corresponds to the animation you want to add. For example, let's say you're trying to add a new 'Sitting' animation. Find the line that starts with [ Sitting ]

11. If the line doesn't have any animations in it, then at the end of the line, type the animation name. If the line already has some animation(s) in it, then at the end of this line, type the | character, and then type/paste the name of your animation. Make sure you don't add any spaces around the animation names. Look at the other lines in the notecard to see what it should look like. Make sure you spell the animation name right. Make sure you have the capitalization right. A good way to do this is to copy the animation's name by right-clicking on it and selecting 'Properties'. Once you are done, it should look like this:

[ Sitting ]CrossLeggedSit|MaleSit1|NewAnimationYouAdded

12. Repeat the previous step for all the animations you want to add. You can repeat lines if you need to. For example, if you want to add a large number of walks, you can split them up across multiple lines like this:

[ Walking ]MaleWalk1|MaleWalk2|MaleWalk3
[ Walking ]MaleWalk4|MaleWalk5|MaleWalk6

Make sure that both lines start with [ Walking ], and the script will combine the specified animations.

13. Save this notecard.

14. Drag the notecard you just created/saved from your inventory into the ZHAO-II's inventory.

15. Take the ZHAO-II back into your inventory.

16. Wear the ZHAO-II.

17. Click the Menu button on the ZHAO-II.

18. Click the 'Load' button in the dialog menu.

19. Click the button that has the name of your new notecard in it.

20. Wait for the ZHAO-II to tell you that it's finished loading the new notecard.

21. Your new animations should now be activated. If you added a new walk/sit/ground sit (for example, you added a 3rd walk), you need to select that number on the corresponding menu (click on Walks, then select the 3rd walk).

If you run into any trouble trying to make this work, see my profile picks for instructions on how to report your problems and get help.

Changes from ZHAO
=============

This section is for people familiar with the old ZHAO. 

The new (and hopefully improved) ZHAO-II - easier to setup, new features, less lag. This is a free product, and all the scripts are open source. You can distribute this product and modify/build upon it. Licensing information is provided at the end of this notecard.

The notecard format has changed. The new notecard is NOT backwards compatible with existing ZHAO notecards. If you don't feel like re-writing the notecard by hand (and you probably won't), rez the provided 'Notecard Converter' object and follow its instructions. The reason for the change - I think the new notecard is a lot easier to set up. Open up the provided 'Default' notecard to see the new format.

Inventory checks - ZHAO-II will warn you if it finds an animation in the notecard that's not in inventory. This will help with typing errors, missing inventory, and so on.

Up to 12 walks, sits and ground-sits.  Why 12? Because I'm lazy, and wanted to fit them on one dialog box. 

As many stands as you want, until the script runs out of memory. If you add too many stands, the script will crash, and then you'll have to remove some stands and reset the scripts. How many is too many? Hard to say, depends on how many other animations you've configured. Use the free memory as your guide - if it gets too close to 0%, you're obviously asking for trouble.

New options for cycling stands. You can have stands cycle sequentially, or randomly. You can choose the time duration between stand changes. You can turn off automatic stand cycling, and use the 'Next Stand' command to cycle stands manually.

Easier for developers to build and customize their own AOs. No more scripted texture changes, so you can apply whatever textures you want. The only visual impact of the script will be to set a green/gray tint on the root On/Off prim. Also, the main script can now be controlled by sending it link messages (details in the script comments). So you could design a new user interface and build a new HUD attachment, and use the ZHAO-II script to perform the AO functions.
