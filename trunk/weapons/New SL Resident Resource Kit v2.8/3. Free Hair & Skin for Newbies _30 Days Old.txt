INTRODUCTION

     Are you a new resident less than 30 days old?  You are eligible for some great freebies from established and wonderful creators.  

     Regular, available any time, freebies and near freebies are found on the notecard entitled "2. Landmarks (places to shop or acquire things)".

     At this time, if you have no money, then perhaps a brief camping stint might be in order.  Type "camping" in the [Search] on the bottom of your screen and you'll find some places to earn a few Linden Dollars.

     Normally you cannot camp for lengthy periods of time or you will log out (and lose your money).  To prevent this (another tip from BW Jinxing, thank you), from the main menu click CLient> Character> Character Tests and uncheck [Go Away/AFK When Idle].
