    1. Rez the BNWCS Respawn point.
    
        By default, anyone who dies while wearing a BNWCS will respawn to this point. If you want to limit a respawn point to a certain team (say, one for each team's base,) you can edit the respawn point's description, changing "public" to the (all-lowercase) name of the team you want to use the respawn point. For example, to create a respawn point for "Red Team" in the "Red Team Base," rez a respawn point in the "Red Team Base," and change the word "public" in its description to "red" - it should then be "10,red" in the description. "red", "blue", "yellow", and "green" are the four possible teams.

    2. To change the respawn TIME, simply change the number in the Respawn point's description, making sure to keep the comma and the word after it.

    3. The Respawn Point is moddable, so you can change its color and look to match your area's theme.

= Notes
=====

    A "public" respawn point will be used by anyone and everyone. This includes avatars on a team who do NOT have a dedicated "team" respawn point.
    
    A "team" respawn point (red, blue, yellow, or green) will be used ONLY by avatars who die while a member of that team.

    Respawn point not working right? Drop me, Matthias Rozensztok, an IM or Notecard, and I'll see what I can do about whipping it into shape.
