= Basic Setup
=====

    1. Wear the "BNWCS v<some number>" object.
    
    2. If you want to have your health and combat status displayed on your HUD, in addition to floating text over your avatar's head, wear the "BNWCS HUD" object, as well.

    3. Your BNWCS will load in "non-combative" mode, meaning you cannot be damaged. Type "/8 on" to enter combative mode, and "/8 off" to return to non-combative mode.

    4. That's all you need to know to begin! Read on for more...

= Usage
=====

    1. BNWCS will respond to the following chat commands:
    
        /8 on
                        Will switch to "combative" mode, where you can take damage and be killed.
                    
        /8 off
                        Will switch to "non-combative" mode, where you cannot take damage and cannot be killed. You cannot switch out of combative mode if your health is not full.

        /8 reset
                        Will restart your BNWCS. You can only restart it while in "non-combative" mode. Taking off and re-attaching the BNWCS will also restart it.

        /8 team <color>
                        Will switch your team to the specified team. Currently only the following teams are accepted:
                        red, blue, yellow, green, none
                        
                        What do teams do? When you die, if a respawn point is set up for your team, you will be returned to that respawn point.
                        If your team does not have a respawn point, or you do not have a team, a "public" respawn point will be used.
                        Teams also are shown above your avatar, to make identification of teammates and enemies easier.
                        You will not take damage from team members, even if they shoot you.
                        
        /8 respawn
                        Will return you to full health and "combative" mode after you've died and your respawn counter reaches zero. Most of the time, respawning should be automatic, but if something goes wrong, this will enable you to rejoin the battle anyway.

        /8 handicap <number>|off
                        Will cause you to take <number> times as much damage as normal... you can use this to weaken yourself and make things a little fairer if you're cleaning up... or if you're trying to use some sort of weapon that doesn't do sufficient damage normally. '/8 handicap off' will return your damage-taking to the normal level.

        /8 stats
                        Will tell you your statistics for your current sim, and for the whole grid. Statistics include kills, deaths, assists, kill per death ratio, longest life, and ranking. Only you will see them.
        
        /8 say stats
                        Will say your stats in open chat, so that anyone can see.
                        
        /8 male
        /8 female
                        Will change the sounds that play when your avatar is hit.
                        
        /8 lag
                        Will tell you about the current simulator performance with respect to scripts and physics. 100% is perfect. If these numbers are very low, that could explain why your BWNCS is not working quite right. Be patient; it will clear up.
                        
        /8 help
                        Will give you this notecard.

= Notes
=====

    Statistics:
            Visit http://www.bnwcs.org to view and sort statistics for individual players, ranking by sim and grid, and to find BNWCS combat zones.
    
    Critical Hits:
            Sometimes, when you are hit, a "ding" will play, and a "critical hit" graphic (that may look somewhat familiar...) will appear. Critical Hits currently do four times the damage of a normal hit, and temporarily stop your HP from regenerating. Headshots are always a critical hit.

    Collision:
            An object must be moving at least 15 meters/second to be counted by the BNWCS as a "hit" - this prevents things like bumping into a wall from damaging you.

    Falls:
            If you fall and hit something at more than 15 meters/second, you will take damage! Be careful!

    Damage:
            Damage is based on both object velocity, and object mass. Larger things do more damage. Faster things do more damage. Really large and fast things will probably get you yelled at.

    Bullets:
            Some bullets die off immediately upon collision with a target. While this is arguably better for sim performance, and certainly prevents defense HUDs from retaliating against you, a side-effect is that these bullets do not exist long enough for scripts to determine who fired them. If your gun fires this kind of bullet, the BNWCS may be unable to credit you for your kills. If you kill someone and their BWNCS merely announces that they "were killed," rather than "killed by [Avatar Name]," then you ARE firing that kind of bullet.

    Skulls:
            When you die, your BNWCS will rez a skull with your name and your killer's name, along with the time of death, imprinted on it. This skull may be bought for L$0, and can serve as a souvenir for whoever grabs it.

    Optional Combat Zone Components:
            If the owner of whichever area you are fighting in has chosen, there may be one or more "Respawn Points" or "Health Packs" around. When you die, if there is a respawn point, your BNWCS will rez a teleporter to take you to the respawn point, and restore you to "combative" mode only once you arrive back at the respawn point.

            If the owner of the combat area has placed BNWCS "health packs," you can recover lost health by running into one. The amount of health recovered can vary - maybe the owner will have marked it, or maybe you'll be surprised by how much health you recover.

    If you encounter any problems with your BNWCS that can't be fixed by removing it and re-attaching it, feel free to drop a notecard or IM to "Matthias Rozensztok," and I'll see what I can do to fix it.
