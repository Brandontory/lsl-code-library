Cid Vilas here.  Thank you for taking interest in this Particle Generator.  I began this project
to make a generator instead of buying one, but i got side tracked and now i dont want to
finish it.  It has alot of useful features that many people will enjoy. 

If you appreciate what i have provided please feel free to donate and send some linden moneys
my way.  Even 1 L$ is appreciated.

I didnt document the script very well but i dont feel i have the time to anymore.  Simple explanation
would be that the buttons contain the display code and the sphere contains the particle gen code
and button press detection code.

Feel free to document it as much as possible and redistribute this item.

I do as for everyone to NOT...NEVER under any cercumstances Resell this item!  EVER.  This was given
out for free and must continue being free.  There is alot of people out there with the need for this.

SHARE  Second life forever!  Whooo!!

My future mall is in    �
