    Approved Freebie Guns
    Updated: 04/16/2009
    
The "Cain Weapons M590 Assault Rifle" has been approved for use in the combat area(s) located at the following landmark. It has been modified to remove particle effects, griefer-type bullets, and shell ejection in order to reduce lag. Please note that the use of other guns is also allowed, provided that they adhere to the rules set forth by management. The "Cain Weapons M590 Assault Rifle" meets all rules and should be used as a "freebie" gun whenever another suitable gun cannot be obtained by a resident. Since we are a weapons outlet, we invite you to browse our products if you are interested in purchasing a commercially available gun.

If you would like to pick up a copy of the current rules, please visit the landmark below. A copy of the rules has also been included in this box.
If you have any questions, please contact Xantarius Cain in-world.
