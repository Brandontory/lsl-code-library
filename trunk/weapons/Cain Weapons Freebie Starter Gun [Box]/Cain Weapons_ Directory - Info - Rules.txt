COMBAT RULES
==========
The following rules apply to the Combat Skybox area (see below). Violations may result in ejection from our land and temporary or permanent bans.

- FREEBIE GUNS (MUST READ): A suitable freebie gun can be purchased for L$0 near the entrance of the main store (first floor). This is the preferred freebie gun for use here at Cain Weapons because it does not have particle effects, shell ejection, bullet sparks, or other such features that slow down the sim for other residents. Please use this gun if you are unable to purchase a commercial gun that allows you to turn off special effects.
- You must wear the DCS2 HUD if you are going to participate in combat while in the skybox. This HUD can be purchased for L$75 in the main store and the Combat Skybox safe area.
- Firing on or attacking other players in the SAFE ZONE of the Combat Skybox is prohibited. This is the small room where players first arrive when they teleport into the Combat Skybox. It is clearly marked.
- Anyone who has their DCS2 set to combative (stats will display above their head) may be shot. Those set to "NonCombative" may not be shot. If you do not wish to be shot, you must use the "/9off" command to set DCS2 to NonCombative.
- When you are killed, IMMEDIATELY STOP SHOOTING. Wait until you come back to life before you begin shooting again.
- Never shoot your weapons or attack others in the Combat Skybox when you are in NonCombative mode. This is unfair to other players. It is best to be in the SAFE ZONE when you are NonCombative.
- Always remember to use the "/9on" command (to turn DCS2 on again) when you come back to life after being killed. You will be in NonCombative mode when you return to life.
- Only Damage or Training bullets are allowed in combat. Turn off all sparks, shell ejection, and particle effects on your guns/bullets. Also, the following bullet types are NOT ALLOWED and should not be used (see the note on FREEBIE GUNS above):
                - Tracking and/or targeting bullets
                - Bullets that produce smoke
                - Rockets and/or granades
                - Nukes, Missiles, Bombs, Mines, etc.
                - Fire-producing bullets
                - Push, orbit, and/or trap bullets
                - ANY TYPE OF GRIEFER BULLETS NOT ALREADY MENTIONED ABOVE (this includes HUD weapons)!
- Anything that gives you an unfair advantage over other players is strictly prohibited. This includes the use of shields, HUD weapons, movement enhancers, and vehicles.
- Flying is prohibited in the Combat Skybox but is allowed anywhere else on our land. Since we cannot turn off flying only for the Combat Skybox, it is turned on. Do not use it while inside the Combat Skybox.
- Bullet velocity MUST be set to 100 or LESS.
- Freebie guns that do not produce damage should not be used in combat.


============
SHOOTING RANGES
============
The area outside of the store on the same parcel of land contains a shooting range that is open to the public. You are also free to shoot zombies in the warhouse outside of the main store. Please refrain from shooting other players without their permission (see RULES above). Also, please refrain from firing weapons into nearby land that is not owned by Cain Enterprises.


===========
COMBAT SKYBOX
===========
􀀁
If you are looking for freeform, open-fire combat, bring your friends to the combat skybox. This location can be accessed from any teleporter on our land. Simply select "Combat Skybox" from the teleport list. Rules for the Combat Skybox are listed above under COMBAT RULES.

The Combat Skybox is designed to be used by either individual players or groups of players. Zombie pools will rez zombies that players will need to kill as they move around certain areas of the Combat Skybox. These pools may be turned off for special events.


==========
CLUB & LOUNGE
==========
􀀀
The warehouse just outside of the main store is infested with zombies...but the roof is perfectly safe. Our dance club and lounge is located on the roof of the warehouse and you can head over there for a drink, good conversation, live events, and dancing!


Enjoy the store, shooting ranges, combat skybox, and dance club!
