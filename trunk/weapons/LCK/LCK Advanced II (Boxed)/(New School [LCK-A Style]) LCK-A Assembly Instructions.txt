LCK Advanced Assembly instructions.
===============================
NOTICE:
These instructions assume a couple of things. One, that this is just the saber kit without a hilt attached to it. Two, that the reader has at least basic knowledge of the edit-mode tools involving moving the position of a linked-set object. And three, construction is taking place in an area with prim allowance of at least 40 prims. A quiet sandbox is ideal.

This is not a guide on building a hilt. The hilt should be something unique to you, the reader. However there are many places one might find a ready made hilt. Be it from tearing down an older saber, or building one yourself. :) Needless to say, Hilt making is beyond the scope of these instructions.
================================

NOTES FOR DOUBLE-BLADED SABER:
These steps are the same for the most part, but will need to be done twice, once for each blade. For the second blade, the command starts with '/ls2' instead of '/ls'. 
Also, the blade will need to come out of the bottom of your saber hilt, so adjust the position accordingly.
=================================

Without further delay, here's the instructions. :)

Step 1:
Rez your hilt in world and ensure that it is pointing straight up and down. Ideally, the root prim of the hilt would be the main handle and it would be in position at a rotation of 0,0,0. See image for an example.

?

Step 2:
Make sure you are in edit mode on your hilt, Right-click and select edit. Click on the "More" button, and the click on the "Contents" tab.
Locate the script "LCK-A Hilt Dummy Script" in your inventory. It should be packaged with the LCK-A at time of purchase. Click on this script and drag it into the contents of your hilt.
See the image for an example.

?

Step 3:
Rez the LCK Advanced in world near your hilt. See image for an example.

?

A menu popup should come up at the top-right of your screen asking permissions to allow linking and de-linking to other objects. Click on yes. 
See image for an example.

?

Step 4:
Make sure you know the complete case sensitive name of your hilt, then type the command into chat:

/ls hilt <your hilt name>

Replace <your hilt name> with the complete name of your hilt. See the image for an example.

?

The LCK-A should jump to the position of your hilt. The root prim of the LCK-A(yellow cylinder) will be positioned on the root prim of your hilt. See the attached image for an example.

?

Step 5:
Using the position tools in the edit mode, position the LCK-A so that the very top surface of the calibrator(White Cylinder) is positined center and just barely above the top of the hilt. Remember that the blade emits from just below the top surface of the calibrator. See attached image for an example.

?

Step 6:
Once you are satisfied with the position of the calibrator and your hilt, type the command:

/ls link

This will automatically link the two together into a single object, set the saber's name, delete the position and dummy scripts in the LCK-A and activate the main saber script. See the image for an example.

?

To create your throw bullet:
1) Rez the Throw Bullet kit like you would the LCK-A kit.
2) Attach it to your hilt using the same procedure you used to assemble your saber.
3) Delete the object "Throw Bullet" inside your completed saber.
4) Pick up the assembled Bullet, and place it in your completed saber. (It goes in Primary blade only, not offhand. In Double Bladed Sabers, it goes in the double bladed saber.)


===================================

Congradulations. :) Your Lightsaber is now ready to use. Take it back into inventory. Right-click on it in inventory and select "Wear". You may need to adjust the position to your liking.

To hide the calibrator, type 

/ls hide cal

Now refer to the command and control notecards to learn how to use your saber. :)
