BattleZone Combat System Certification
======================================

BattleZone is dedicated to providing fun, fair combat to Second Life. Our goals have always been to help make more realistic combat for everyone making use of the system. We have just started a new Certification program to help certify what weapons are actually not just compliant or compatible to the combat system, but actually certified for use with BattleZone.

With this, there are two levels of certification to choose from. One higher than the other and more specific, encompassing all of the previous requirements and adding more refined details of play.

1. Melee Weapon Specifications:
-------------------------------

Kicks, Punches, and close-range weapons such as daggers, should not exceed a hit range more than 2.0 meters, and a speed faster than 0.5 seconds between attacks, and a sensor radius no wider than 90 degrees. Damage dealt by these types may only use, kick, punch, or dagger damage appropriately.

Shortswords should not exceed a hit range more than 2.5 meters, and hit no faster than once every 0.65 seconds, also with a sensor radius not to exceed any greater than 90 degrees. Damage dealt by these types may either only use sword damage exclusively, or offer a variety of attacks including kicks, punches, and even a sword stab, which can deal greater damage using great with limitations: Sword stabs should not be wider than 45 degrees and not exceed 2.5 meters, and be usable only once per 1 second.

Longswords, short spears, and javelins used as melee combat, should not exceed 3.0 meters, and not exceed 0.8 seconds between attacks. Damages dealt by these types may either only use sword damage exclusively, or offer a variety of attacks including kicks, punches and even blunt or stabbing attacks appropriately as follows:
  Longswords may stab at a rate of 1.2 seconds, with a sensor arc not to exceed 45 degrees and range no greater than 3.0 meters using great damage.
  Normal sword attacks should not exceed a 90 degree attack radius.

  Short Spears may stab at a rate of 1.2 seconds with a sensor arc not to exceed 45 degrees and range no greater than 3.0 meters using great damage.
  At 2.5 - 3.0 meters, spears may do sword damage as if the spear were swung like a staff, but the sharp tip cut.
  Anything below 2.5 meters may inflict at most, kicking damage, as if the shaft of the spear hit.

  Javelins used in melee are stabbing weapons only, therefore it may only be used to damage with great damage at 2.5 - 3.0 meters using great damage,
  and do at most great damage. Javelins being swung would effectively break the weapons and thus do no damage.

Long spears & Polearms should not exceed 3.5 meters, attack once per 1.2 seconds, and have a radius no greater than 90 degrees, to do great damage, or 90 degrees to do kick damage by the shaft. When swung, as much as great damage could be used within 3.0 - 3.5 meters, while anything less than 3.0 meters could do kick damage represented by the shaft hitting.

Axes are short to long imbalanced weapons, ranging from mere hatches & tomohawks, to large polearmed axes. For this we'll classify each one specifically:
  Small Axes (Hatchets, Tomahawks, etc): Not to exceed a range greater than 2.25 meters, hit no faster than once per 0.7 seconds, use a radius no wider
  than 90 degrees, and deal no greater than axe damage.

  Medium Axes: Not to exceed a range greater than 2.75 meters, hit no faster than once per 1 second, with a radius not to exceed 90 degrees, and deal
  no greater than axe damage. For any hit that strikes less than 2.0 meters, should deal no greater than kick damage represented by the pole hitting.

  Great Axes: Not to exceed a range greater than 3.5 meters, hit no faster than once per 1.4 seconds, have a radius not to exceed 90 degrees, and deal
  no greater than axe damage. For any hit that strikes less than 3.0 meters may deal kick damage, representing the pole hitting.



2. Thrown & Projectile Specifications:
--------------------------------------

I. Thrown weapons

1. General Guideline: For all thrown and projectile weapons, depending on velocity, needs to be a certain length to be able to function 100% properly in Second Life's physics system.
    20 m/s and below, needs to have a 1-meter long prim involved, along the X axis being the length, would be 1.0 x 0.1 x 0.1, on average.
    30-40 m/s, needs to have a 1.5-meter long prim involved, along the X axis being the length, would be 1.5 x 0.1 x 0.1, on average.
    40+ m/s, needs to have a 2.0-meter long prim involved, along the X axis being the length, would be 2.0 x 0.1 x 0.1, on average.
    Nothing may be any faster then 60 m/s, under all circumstances!

Thrown weapons do not often deal as much damage as weapons being projected from a high-powered weapon, such as a bow, therefor there are several types of classes and damage rates for these weapons.

Palm-sized rocks and equivalents, may use thrown damage, and not to exceed a velocity greater than 20 meters/second. Buoyancy on rocks depends greatly on the mass and distance it can travel while thrown straight at a target range not exceeding 29 meters, rate of fire should be no faster than 1 per second.

Daggers and small bladed weapons, including shurikens, may use dagger damage and not exceed 25 meters/second with a straight-shot range not to exceed 29 meters, and rate of fire not to exceed faster than 1 per 1.5 seconds.

Javelins, Short Spears, may use sword damage and not exceed 30 meters/second and with a straight-shot range not to exceed 39 meters, with rate of fire not to exceed 1 throw per 2 seconds.

Longspears may use great damage and not exceed 30 meters/second, reach further than 39 meters and have a rate of fire not to exceed 1 throw per 2.5 seconds.

II. Projectiles

Short bows vary greatly from power, depending on rate of fire, range of flight in straight shot. A general minimum velocity should be 30 meters/second, and based on a range of up to 40 meters at 30m/s, and 80 meters at 60m/s, dealing arrow damage. Sensors should only be used up to 3.5 meters, upon hitting a non-agent target, to scan for a sitting agent only, since collisions to someone sitting will pick up the prim they are sitting on.  Otherwise, if the arrow hits a prim and doesn't find a sitting agent within proximity, it should directly attack the named object it struck initially.
    At up to 40 meters, rate of fire should not exceed one shot per 1 second.
    At up to 80 meters, rate of fire should not exceed one shot per 2 seconds.

Long bows vary greatly from power, depending on rate of fire, range of flight in straight shot. A general minimum velocity should be 30 meters/second, and based on a range of up to 70 meters at 30m/s, and 180 meters at 60m/s, dealing longarrow damage. Sensors should only be used up to 3.5 meters, upon hitting a non-agent target, to scan for a sitting agent only, since collisions to someone sitting will pick up the prim they are sitting on.  Otherwise, if the arrow hits a prim and doesn't find a sitting agent within proximity, it should directly attack the named object it struck initially.
    At up to 70 meters, rate of fire should not exceed one shot per 3.5 second.
    At up to 180 meters, rate of fire should not exceed one shot per 4.5 seconds.

Light Crossbow (Calvary Crossbow) are not variable speed projectiles and should have a max speed of 45 m/s reaching a maximum range of 60 meters, dealing lightbolt damage. Sensors should only be used up to 3.5 meters, upon hitting a non-agent target, to scan for a sitting agent only, since collisions to someone sitting will pick up the prim they are sitting on.  Otherwise, if the bolt hits a prim and doesn't find a sitting agent within proximity, it should directly attack the named object it struck initially.

Heavy Crossbow (Infantry Crossbow) are not variable speed projectiles and should have a max speed of 60 m/s reaching a maximum range of 90 meters, dealing heavybolt damage. Sensors should only be used up to 3.5 meters, upon hitting a non-agent target, to scan for a sitting agent only, since collisions to someone sitting will pick up the prim they are sitting on.  Otherwise, if the bolt hits a prim and doesn't find a sitting agent within proximity, it should directly attack the named object it struck initially.

Gold Certification:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Gold Certification implies a bit more restrictions, to add more realism, where sims would prefer more realism added in. It imposes limits and timed recovery periods, in which ammo-oriented or thrown weapons have basic constraints.

Javelins, for each number up to a maximum of 9 javelins, a 15 second time to recover per javelin allowed. In example, if you made 9 javelins available to throw, it would take 135 seconds to recover them back after all are thrown. The weapon would not be usable for melee or throwing after all have been thrown, until the full recovery time has passed.

Spears, being long and uneasy to carry multiple, once thrown, it should be unavailable for melee usage, and throwing for 120 seconds.

Bows, similarly to javelins, may have up to two dozen (24) arrows, and for each number of arrows made available, each one would count for 20 seconds to regain back. For example, if you made 24 arrows available, it would take 480 seconds to regain back all the arrows after all are fired. 

Other miscellaneous thrown weapons, such as rocks, may have up to 12, depending on size of the items in question, and count for 12 seconds per allowed count available. For example, if you made 12 rocks available, it would take 144 seconds to regain back the rocks after all are thrown.
