Terra E-Chute
=========
􀀁

The Terra E-Chute is an emergency parachute designed to save pilots from unfortunate encounters with the ground. It's use is limited to auto-deploying when you free-fall below 100 meters. Unlike a full-featured parachute, the E-Chute is designed simply to prevent unfortunate pilot-protein splatters.

* Eject from aircraft safely.

* Prevent unfortunate falls from high structures.

* Arrive at events in style.

* Includes skydiving freefall and steering poses by Apotheus Silverman.

* Textures by Grey Nolder.

The E-Chute is re-usable and comes in a discreet fanny pack.

Remember: falling is fine. It's what happens when you meet the ground that you have to worry about.

---
How to use:

Attach the E-Chute to your avatar's pelvis (it's stored in a fanny pack). If your avatar is freefalling above a certain speed and below 100 meters above the ground, the parachute will deploy automatically. 

To deploy your parachute manually, say "pull".

To close your parachute manually, say "close".
