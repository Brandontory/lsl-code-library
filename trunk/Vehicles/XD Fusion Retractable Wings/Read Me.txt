Hope you enjoy this XD Fusion freebie!

Just wear the wings and fly.   The wings will expand when you're flying and automatically retract and fade away when you're not. 

To create this type of wing with Puppeteer, use the "On-fly" trigger with "Ping-Pong" playing style.  The transparency was done using a separate script.

Feel free to share this gift with your friends.  Just remember that this is NOT for resell. Giving away free is perfectly ok =]

Enjoy

Sincerely,
Todd Borst
