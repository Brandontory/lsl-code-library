About UFO Gestures:

        Here is a box containing every UFO command necessary for the safe operation of your UFO by Mark Coffee.  They are gestures, and to install them you will need to rez the box labeled "UFO Gestures" where you are allowed to build, then right-click on the box and select "open".  Here you will see the contents of the box in your window.  Please close the folder in that box, and then drag the Contents folder to a "New Folder" in your Gestures folder.  The gestures should all transfer into that folder, where you can then right click on the individual gestures and select "activate".  Having done so, rename the newly filled folder something unique, like "UFO Control Gestures" or any other name that you will remember.

        I have selected rarely used triggers for each gesture, but in the event there is a conflict with a gesture you already have, these gestures are all modifiable and you can open the conflicting gestures and change it's trigger.  Be sure to activate both gestures afterwards, the one you edited and the one that was turned off by the conflict.

As a note the gestures are:

.t                      Turn on Terra Combat system
.r                      Turn off Terra Combat system


Remember:  To start the UFO you must left-click the body of the craft and to stop it left-click it again.  This means when you are firing the Terra Combat cannon avoid mouse clicking the UFO, it will turn off at a high altitude and need to be turned back on, during which time you are a sitting duck vulnerable to attack.

Happy Flying,
