Thank you for choosing to use the Orb Combat System!
Here are some basic commands to get you started. Be sure you are wearing both your Orb Combat system AND your HUD.

While in roleplay mode:

/2 help                     - gives this notecard
/2 ooc                      - enters OOC mode
/2 title <name>         - sets your title to <name>

While in OOC mode:

/2 help                     - gives this notecard
/2 rp                      - enters RP mode (you can only do this after a certain time has passed)
/2 title <name>         - sets your title to <name>

While in combat or while dead:

/2 reset                    - resets health and stamina, enters OOC mode
/2 ooc                       - same effect as /2 reset

While in any mode you may disable the Orb HUD messages (people dying/cheating etc) by touching the HUD. Touch it again to re-enable the messages.

Currently the Orb responds to ranged damage (physical weapons) as well as melee damage (done by weapons that use keystroke combinations). Any physical object that begins with the three characters "RO-" (roleplay object) will not do damage.

Be aware that if you shoot or attack too fast (automatic weapons will notice this most) your stamina will be penalized, and you will lose health if your stamina runs out!  Keep your firing/attack rate reasonable to avoid this.

To block while in combat, press and hold left mouse button AND page down (crouch). If you have your chat window closed, the letter c will work the same as page down if you prefer WASD controls.  Block will also hold through jump if you hold left mouse. 

Please join the Orb Users Community Group! It is open join, and you can discuss orb issues/questions with other users. 

The Orb is in BETA! Keep this in mind.  However most bugs have been resolved. If you find a bug, report it to Furia Freeloader ASAP.
