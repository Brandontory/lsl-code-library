This is the absolute best way for you to get information about the CCS system and to interact with the developers to report bugs.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Secondary Skill Bank is set up using the "Set Buttons" option on the main menu. This allows you to set up 3 more skills for one click access ON TOP of your HUD hotkeyed abilities.

Ignore buttons no longer break CCS categories.

Some commands are still typed in:

/9level
/9color <255,255,255>
/9title
/9title none

All other /9commands, while still working when typed,  are actually available on the CCS Main Menu now.

All GM Functions are now available via the GM menu which appears to authorized CCS GMs in the system, the "Force" option ONLY shows for CCS Global GMs which allows them to enable their GM tag in sims where they are not normally a GM.

The Hovertext points on the HUD are modifiable and will not be perfectly aligned for all users depending on your native screen resolution, use the 1024 HUD if you're using a small screen resolution and the 1280 rez HUD if you're using a larger monitor resolution, you can edit the HUD then use Edit Linked Parts, then hit CTRL+ALT+T to highly transparent objects and click the red circles you see under the hover text to move the hovertext objects into more perfect position if the text seems seriously out of position for you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.4.9-7
- XP Curve adjusted, levels will be adjusted backwards by a small amount to adjust the entire network to the new, more accurate XP curve. You may lose a level or more, you WILL have to respec and redistribute your stats and chose new abilities as all characters will be set to level 1 and their stats will be zeroed out but you will retain your XP.
- Added fix to Lycan Rage, Rage now requires a percentage multiplier per level increasing the amount of damage a lycan must take to gain one point of rage with every level. This balances the Lycan racial situation, which at levels above 10 was not presenting enough risk for the damage bonus the Rage series gives.
- Added fix to Human Spirit, Human Spirit armor value now scales with level on a percentage based multiplier, allowing humans to increase the effectiveness of Spirit as they grow in levels, there has been no change to Spirit point generation, it is still on a timer.
- Changed strength calculations to value > level, rather than the other way around, you can now exceed your characters level expected damage by investing points in strength, just like you would if you invested points in fortitude and endurance.
- HUD Compiled to Mono, now both the meter and the HUD are using the Mono system base.
- There is a mandatory respec with this release, you will be required to respec, it is a free racial/class respec, you can change to any class or race....but you MUST respec.
0.4.9-6
- Fixed a level up exploit that allowed for infinite level ups. Deleted all characters that abused the exploit as well.
- Fixed GM Revive/Kill not working on high level characters.
- Entire script base now compiled in Mono.
0.4.9-5
* Added new stat display features for the purposes of lowering metagaming and making it less easy to judge a targets abilities at first glance:
    - Meters at full health will display 100% Health/100% Stamina as long as no damage is taken.
    - Damage taken then reverts the display to show true HP/Stamina values to allow for user/target monitoring.
    - /9hidestats works as before, and when in default mode, if using /9hidestats, all that shows on the meter is version and 100% Health/100% Stamina, character level/race/class shows when damage is taken as before.
* Decreased global melee delay to 0.60 from 0.70 at the suggestion of several players. This melee delay is global to all CCS sims.

0.4.9-4
* Fixed out of bounds errors in GM Module
* Fixed spam messages from the meter when being hit by collision based weapons
* Fixed running sideways not costing stamina, running any direction now costs stamina.

0.4.9-3
* Fixed start up errors permanently this time, you will no longer have problems setting up skills on the HUD or get http related error messages when attaching the meter.
* Fixed reversed logic for health deduction for running at 0 stamina, running when at 0 stamina will no longer heal a player.
* Added a new feature, Non-Combat Stamina regen, if a player has taken no damage for 120 seconds, stamina is regenerated at a highly increased rate, allowing players to regain playability much faster without the need for a hospital visit. Health still regenerates at normal rate.
0.4.9-2
* Fixed start up errors in the system, you should no longer have problems setting hotkeys on first attach. You may still see a http request warning, it will not affect the system, we are tracking that error down.
* Adjusted stamina deduction for jumping to 2.5% of total stamina per jump, it was set at 10%, this was a planned feature for 0.5.0 that we added to this release to cut down on kiting....10% was determined to be too restrictive.
* Added health penalty for running or jumping while at 0 Stamina, you will now "bleed" hitpoints at the same rate you'd lose stamina for running or jumping while having zero stamina, this is in place to cut down on kiting.

!!! Please keep in mind this has been an emergency update, some features introduced are NOT finalized and were planned for the 0.5.0 release that we've been working on, as always, CCS is a live development project, if there are problems with the features we implement, we will adjust them.

!!! No respec has been issued for this version, theres one coming soon though.

!!! CCS enhanced objects are still offline because the API is attempting to talk to the original primary server, we will get them back online as soon as we get the CCS primary server moved to its new hosting situation.

-Changes in 0.4.7-
- Skipped a few version numbers in the read me and I can't remember why. Oh well.
- Updated Comm.lsl to disallow in world XP awards, GMs with back end access can still award XP.
- Updated CCS healing particles to be alot more identifiable as someone "healing" themselves.
-Changes in 0.4.4-
- Addition of new system abilities, you can now have Heal over Time abilities and Damage over Time abilities. Damage Over Time abilities are being built into the current DPS class abilities as they fit that classes role most primarily. All races are getting a level 10 HoT which is designed to be racially specific for each race, some heal for more per tick than others this is due to the way the races generate their racial power pool points. For example:

A Lycan generates 1 point of rage for every 15 points of damage taken. The Lycan's "Channel Rage" ability, does a Heal over TIme for 15 points per tick for 60 seconds(a HoT and DoT tick are much faster than the standard "tick" used by CCS), allowing for in combat regeneration as long as they are taking damage, but not enough healing to overcome damage being dealt, keeping them from becoming unkillable in combat. Since Channel Rage requires the use of 4 Rage points, it cannot be used quickly enough to make a Lycan totally impervious to damage, and it sacrifices their enhanced damage capabilities.

Angels on the other hand have the Mercy ability, which does a 50 point per tick HoT on a 20m radius around the caster, because it does not directly benefit the caster and because Angels generate their prayers through blessing others, 50 points per tick, while substantial is in line because it cannot directly make the casting angel impervious to damage but it CAN make a group of them a very potent force. The Neko racial HoT is similar to this in use because of their 9 lives ability and perception buffs.

Balance concerns have been observed in the creation of all the level 10 racial Heal over Time abilities, we hope they add a new dimension to the game and do not unduly unbalance any one race in the face of another.

DoT abilities will fall under status effects associated with offensive abililties, HoT effects come up under the support menu so once you acquire one please ensure you look under support rather than healing for these abilities.

      Level 10 Racial HoT abilities:
      Vampires - Black Regeneration
      Lycans - Channel Rage
      Demons - Cannibalize
      Angels - Mercy
      Supernaturals - Energy Vortex
      Nekos - Lick Wounds
      Humans - StimPack
      
- Added page functionality to dialog menus, more than 12 abilities per category or more than 12 targets for a direct ability will no longer cause a stack heap collission error, dialogs now automatically generate two directional buttons (placement may vary depending on your skills), clicking the button pointing to the right will move on to the next page of skills or targets, clicking the button pointing left will scroll back to the previous page.

- Metrics calculated for post level 10 leveling curve, post level 10 experience is now set to double starting at 15,000 for level ten, 30,000 for level 11, 60,000 for level 12 and so on. This is to keep a flattening of the curve from creating a large gap in the player base.

- System message changed from a dialog menu to a chat history message. CCS notices will now come up in object text in your chat history rather than provide a dialog based message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE FOR 3rd Party Developers: (This only applies to CCS approved weapons developers with a current API package and dynchan module, nothing in this section can applicably be used by anyone without security clearance for the dynchan).

Changes to POISON, HOTs, and DOTs

The Syntax for all three of these functions is:

<type>|<target>|SETSTATUS|<type>|<duration>|<amount>

So to make a heal effect that lasts 2 minutes and heals 10 pts per tick, the syntax would be:

llShout(dynChan,"ALL|ALL|SETSTATUS|HOT|120|10");

This syntax is the same for HOTs, DOTs, and POISON.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Changes in 0.4.3(1)-
- Adjusted ranged damage down to 7 damage per bullet, 10 damage was showing to be far too extreme, 7 damage per hit should still be a substantial increase on pre-0.4.3 damage but should not be making fully automatic weapons the god weapons they've been becoming.
- Temporary fix added to stop base revives from applying a weakness affect to characters. This is to keep people from exploiting the base revives as a method of inducing status effects, we'll be making changes to this system between now and 0.4.5 to get it back in in a fashion that cannot be abused.
-Changes in 0.4.3-
In effort to get the system finished up for the Open Source release we've released a few new prelude features that will be supporting the advanced features we'll be releasing for the 0.4.5 release candidate.

-Added enhanced security features for CCS meter and CCS database. 
-Increased ranged damage ratio: Ranged weapons now do 10 damage per hit this is to bring ranged weaponry back into line with the higher end hitpoints of higher level characters and make guns a threat again. Low level characters will feel this change the most keenly but we feel that is in balance with the level system.
-Altered the way Poison status effects work, now instead of a mere 5 damage per tick, poison status effects hit for the primary damage of the attack every tick. This is in preparation for the enhanced status effect system and the DoT\HoT system being worked on at this time. Due to this change, changes to Neuro-Toxin have been made to ensure the ability is still potent but not instantly lethal. New values for Neuro-Toxin are as follows:

-Neuro-Toxin: 25 damage per tick for 15 seconds
-Neuro-Toxin 2: 35 damage per tick for 15 seconds
-Neuro-Toxin 8: 40 damage per tick for 15 seconds

Because of the strength of this ability reuse timer for them have been set to 60 seconds. 

-Added new ability for Angel race Seraphim healers since they did not get the Neuro-toxin line.
    -Sap Will 1 - Does 25 damage to target stamina and affects the target with a Weakness effect for 15 seconds.
    -Sap Will 4 - Does 50 damage to target stamina and affects the target with a Weakness effect for 15 seconds.
    - Sap Will 8 - Does 75 damage to target stamina and affects the target with a Weakness effect for 15 seconds.

Reuse timer on Sap Will at all levels is 60 seconds.
GMs are authorized a ONE TIME skill replacement for the appropriate level Sap Will for all Serphim angels. Simply contact a CCS GM (preferablly NOT Jora or I unless theres just no one else on that can do it). You MUST have already chosen WHICH skill you will sacrifice to get this ability so please ensure when you contact a GM you have already chosen which skill to sacrifice to get the appropriate level Sap Will.

- Added new particle effect for all SELF heals. If you heal yourself your attackers will see it now and realize you have just healed. This should help in long range battles when you cannot see your enemies meter to help you judge when they've healed themselves or not.

-Added Death Effects: Dying now has a penalty. Being revived by a self revive or waiting the five minute period to regain consciousness will now afflict a character with Weakness for a period of five minutes, characters revived by other characters or healers will only be Weak for two minutes. This is in prepartion for statistic wounds coming in a near future release. Hospitals will be upgraded to clear this affect, also after the island opens and we get the new systems in, "eating" will also clear it....I won't go much further into that just yet.

-General optimizations for efficiency and bug fixes.
-Changes in 0.4.2-
-General Script performance optimizations, CCS should run even more efficiently than it already did.
-Fixed level 8 Angel/Demon triggered revives, these skills will now work, 100 stamina lost still applies.
-System security fixes, old CCS units will not work once v0.4.2 goes live.
-Player Self Delete fixed on back end. Players can now fully reset their own characters race by typing /9profile and clicking the button at the bottom of their profile sheet. ***WARNING*** - You lose all experience and levels if you do this, use ONLY if you wish to start over as a new race and class GMs will NOT reimburse lost experience for players who use this function.
-Changes in 0.4.1-
-Added security to disable an exploit that was allowing people to use multiple units to bypass ability timers. Attempting to utilize a CCS unit in that fashion after this version will cause the unit to self detach and if rezzed unattached it will delete itself.
-Changes in 0.4.0-
Statistic Additions\Stat Revamp

Two new statistics have been added to the system. As well as a total revamp of how character statistics work. They're now far more integral to building your character in regards to how you want to play. All characters now start with a base 15 points in each statistic +20 points in racially divided bonuses throughout the statistic base, then recieves 6 points per level to distribute amongst their stats. This will negate the problems we were having with randomly generated starting statistics affecting character development and give the player direct control of how they want to build their character.

Strength - Strength controls the amount of potential melee damage you do.

Fortitude - Directly affects how many hitpoints you get every time you level up. Your Fortitude base is calculated from your previous level. At level 1, you will have 100 HP, your Fortitude value when you level up will determine what your level 2 HP is.

Endurance - Directly affects how much stamina you get every time you level up. Your Endurance base is calculated from your previous level. At level 1, you will have 100 Stamina, your Endurance value when you level up will determine what your level 2 Stamina is.

Willpower - Willpower now determines your chance to resist all secondary status effects.

Intelligence - A new statistic thats been added to determine a players chance for success at interacting with in world objects. In world objects that will be being introduced are pickable locks, hackable computer systems, arcane incantations for opening portals....with more to come, expect to start seeing these items after the launch of the new city.

Perception - The second new statistic added controls your base chance to dodge attacks. This affects both melee and ranged damage against you. Perception CANNOT be boosted to 100% damage avoidance. It is hard capped at less than 50% no matter HOW many points you put into it.

Racial Statistic Bonuses

Also added in this release are Racial Statistic Bonuses. These are base racial bonuses that are added at the time of creation(or Respec...see below) that give racial benefits to each race based on what I believe their strengths would be. Each race has 20 bonus points assigned variably depending on racial strengths.

Angel - +10 to Fortitude/+10 to Willpower
Demon - +5 to Strength/+5 to Endurance/+5 to Willpower/+5 to Perception
Human - +5 to Fortitude/+5 to Endurance/+10 to Intelligence
Lycan - +10 to Strength/+10 to Fortitude
Neko - +5 to Endurance/+15 to Perception
Supernatural - +5 to Fortitude/+10 to Willpower/+5 to Intelligence
Vampire - +10 to Strength/+5 to Intelligence/+5 to Perception

Current Player Respec

We do have a system that we're going to implement that will reset all characters to the statistics of a level 1 the first time they rez 0.4.0. This will reset your stats to the base 15 points per stat across the board. It will then assign you 10 points + 6 points per level you have on record.

So take me for example. My character is level 9. Adding the 10 starter points a new character gets, thats 64 points to distribute through my stats.

At the Respec page I'd see the following:
64 Points Available [RESET]

15 [+] Strength
15 [+] Fortitude
15 [+] Endurance
15 [+] Willpower
15 [+] Intelligence
15 [+] Perception

I would go through and add those 64 points to my statistics until I was satisfied with them then I'd hit the Continue button at the bottom of the page. Once I did that, I'd be shown a new page showing my stats with the racial bonuses for my race added. Once I hit continue on that, everything is set in stone and I keep my level, abilities and experience, but my stats change.

You can NO LONGER remove points from your statistics once they are applied.

Also added in 0.4.0

    * Web Based Registration System - CCS character registration is now done completely on the web side of the system. When you register a new character or have your record reset you will no longer be asked your race/class/sex choices via a dialog system but be given a drop down that will load the web registration system to your browser.
    * RP Title Meter - To clean up people taking guesses at what you are based on what your CCS unit says. We've added a function to the CCS meter. Typing /9hidestats will hide all information on your CCS Display except the CCS version information and your HP and Stamina. This can be toggled back to normal display by typing /9showstats, or by taking damage from being shot or hit.
    * Web Character Sheet Title - You can now save your CCS title on the website, that way you don't have to retype it all the time. Use the command /9 profile to customize your character profile.
    * Web Character Sheet Photo Upload/bio information - You can now save a photo of your character on your web character sheet and save a small biography about your character there as well so it can be read in world by others. Use the command /9 profile to customize your character profile.
    * Added Interactive Object Support - CCS now has the back end support for interactive in world objects, be on the look out for challenges in this area in the near future.
    * Triggered Revives now drop down a choice menu asking you if you wish to revive, the power pool point is used either way and if you choose NO you will have to be revived by another player or wait five minutes to regain consciousness on your own, this is to facilitate capture scenes and/or RPing defeat.

Bug Fixes:
- Tank Armor should no longer heal the user when being hit for negative damage that cannot damage above the Armor base increase.
- Ressurect-1 Changed from 50 point Health and Stamina revive to 100 point health Revive due to incompatibilities in the way the system handles revives. We will make adjustments to this system in the future to allow for more flexibility.
- Fixed Berserk status effect releasing unit controls.
- Fixed Title bug causing loss of XP, title function moved to web profile.

-Changes in 0.3.7.4-
- Minor communication change to stop the CCS Title from being saved to the database. We believe the long title strings some people were using were actually contributing to experience loss.

-Changes in 0.3.7.3-
- Another script based adjustment to attempt to compensate for bugs introduced to the LSL system by Linden Labs. This should further reduce the chance of phantom experience loss occurring.

-Changes in 0.3.7.2-
-Minor change to http_request handlers in response to a Linden change to the function. We believe this will fix the random experience loss bug we've been seeing in a few cases over the last few days.

-Changes in 0.3.7.1-
-BETA Unit changed to METER to avoid confusion between the HUD and the METER itself when instructing people to remove their BETA unit.
-Fixed bug with database connection failing breaking a CCS unit.
-Fixed blocking while at 0 stamina
-Fixed Select skills system, using heals or other skills using the Select menus will no longer cause stack heap collission errors. Select menu will now only target the 12 closest targets to you within the range of the skill.
-Feature Addition: Races that have a self revive ability will now lose 100 stamina for each revive used. This is to force these races to use their self revive for what its designed for. Level 1 characters reviving once will place them at 0 stamina, higher level characters will have more stamina remaining making them somewhat more resilient to death but even the highest level characters will only be able to survive 2 or 3 deaths before they have no more stamina and are thusly no longer singularly effective.
-GM Tagging is now regional, some GMs have multi-region authority due to the amount of work and support they do for players in both regions, but most GMs in the system are now set to GM in their assigned region.
-Changes in 0.3.7-
- Fixed bug with daze deactivating attached weaponry, dazed targets will still be able to shoot and attack but will not be able to move for the duration of the daze effect. We feel that the stopping power of the daze is enough for the status effect to remain quite powerful. Targets continuing to be able to attack is a side effect of the way SL control systems work and we can either stop them and let them continue to shoot, or can can stop them and deactivate their attached weaponry as well forcing people to have to rearm in the middle of fights which we feel is unacceptable in the game mechanic. An adjustment to your daze tactics will offset this though since while a target CAN still attack for the duration of the daze they cannot turn around to attack you while dazed. 
- We are still tracking a bug in regards to daze causing loss of skill functionality, we believe the above fix should address it, if it does not, please write up a bug report and submit it to Suzanna Soyinka or Jora Welesa.
- Enhanced security functions within the script itself. DO NOT remove the scripts from the CCS unit or you will have a dead CCS unit. Period.
- Minor fix to Vampire Feed ability, it is now a DIRECT ability. Meaning you must be facing your chosen target within 10m of them, best use is direct line of sight. We may change this again but the selection system was top heavy and allowed vampires to feed from 10m away. The new feed attack forces a vampire to get in close.
- Added function to update package,  update packages will now delete themselves if left out for more than five minutes. Unfortunately litter bugs do not pick up their boxes and frankly its not a sim admins job to clean up after slobs. So please transfer your units from the update package to your inventory quickly. After 5 minutes you'll lose it and have to use your old unit to get another one.

====NOTE FROM THE CREATOR====
Due to an rather unpleasant incident, I have been forced to postpone the release of the CCS 3rd Party API. One of the testers whom I shall not name, took it upon himself to use the API to exploit and cheat, which broke the trust I had with him. Until I am able to implement better security into the script, it remains unreleasable. I do apologize for this problem and regret that it has come to this.

-Changes in 0.3.6-
- Triggered Skills VampRevive and Neko9Lives should now properly deduct power pool points.
- Supernatural Shock ability should correctly deduct mana for use.
- Fixed problem with armor and buffs not giving correct mitigation or damage increase.
- Fixed problem with statistic reporting (We are moving the database to a high speed datacenter this weekend so there may be continued anomolies while we make this move.)
- Blocking at 0 stamina will now no longer cause the blocking ability to stick.

As stated, the CCS database is being migrated to a high speed datacenter this weekend, this should give us increased performance and stability for the system. Please bear with us as the system is in transition, we should not lose any data in this transition.

Also there is now a CCS Support Group in SL, the group is open enrollment and joinable via the search function, please join that group if you have any technical problems or CCS related questions.

Coming Soon: http://www.cityoflostangels.biz - A community portal and informational website on the CoLA Game System, Community and Roleplay.

-Changes in 0.3.56-
-Finalized fixes for 0 stamina bug.
-Added CCS update system, all releases after CCS v0.3.56 should automatically update.
-Changes in 0.3.5-
- Major system optimization, the system should be far more responsive and reactive now.
- Increased sensor for DIRECT line of sight attacks, this will give a 90 degree cone in front of the user to land melee abilities, making it much easier for melee based characters to land a status effect on kiters.
- Fixed Dazed status effect, the effect will now stop characters on every successful daze strike.
- Fixed problem with GM system commands, GM XP reward now works! Good RP will be rewarded!
-Increased damage and duration for healer Neurotoxin attacks. Base hit for Neurotoxin and Neurotoxin-2 are now higher, and poison duration lasts longer for both attacks.
-Increased Healer HealMe-2 to 50 points of health for 10 stamina.
-Added Level 8 non-healer HealMe-8 which heals 50 points of health for 50 points of stamina, this power has a 60 second timer, making it ineffective for in battle mitigation but more effective for after battle regeneration/self first aid.
-Added Daze status effect to DPS class Garotte-2, Garotte-1 still weakens. This is to give melee based characters an even chance to put a stop to running targets.

-Changes in 0.3.4-
CCS reaches BETA phase! Woohoo! Thank you everyone for all your help and input so far!

NEW FEATURES/HUD REWORK:((READ THIS ITS IMPORTANT!!!)
1.) New HUD is a single panel unit, due to differences in screen size from user to user. it may not be properly positioned on your screen. The HUD is designed to sit in the upper right corner of your screen, but can be moved at the bottom right or middle right as well. When you click on the white X button on the HUD, it should slide over off the screen to the right, leaving the health meter bars visible, if the info panel is still visible just edit the HUD by right clicking on it and choosing EDIT, then use the green arrow to move the HUD to the right til only the Health and Stamina meters are visible. DO NOT CHANGE THE HUD ATTACHMENT POINT UNLESS YOU ARE EXTREMELY FAMILIAR WITH HOW TO MOVE OBJECTS IN SL. WE DO NOT HAVE TIME TO GIVE BUILD SYSTEM LESSONS TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE DECIDED THAT WEARING THEIR XCITE HUD AT ALL TIMES IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN WEARING THEIR CCS HUD WHILE IN COLA.
2.) Clicking ANYWHERE on the meter bars will expand the HUD information menu.
3.) NEW FEATURE: HOTKEYS - The Hotkey system for CCS works between the HUD and the three new gestures provided with the system, you can now Hotkey one ability to the F3, F4 and F5 keys. To Hotkey an ability do the following.
        A.) Expand the HUD to the info panel by clicking anywhere on the meters.
        B.) Click on any of the F key buttons on the HUD. It will present you with the categories menu.
        C.) Click the category to open the skills menu. (Offensive, Support, Healing)
        D.) Click the skill you wish to assign to that key. You will get a message that the skill is now assigned to that key.
        E.) Activate the CCS HOTKEY F3 - F5 gestures.
        F.) Press the associated F key to immediate execute the hotkey power without having to use any menu interactions at all.
4.) To reassign a hotkey's assigned power, simply click the hotkey you want to reassign and go through the previous steps again. It will clear the currently assigned power and replace it with the new one.
5.) DO NOT CLICK IGNORE ON THE HOTKEY ASSIGNEMENT MENU OR YOU WILL GET LOCKED OUT OF THE SYSTEM FOR A SMALL PERIOD OF TIME. IF YOU DECIDE YOU DO NOT WISH TO HOTKEY A POWER FROM THAT MENU CLICK CANCEL NOT IGNORE.
6.) New HUD system is designed for as much speed as possible and to use up as little screen real estate as possible. The meter though is susceptible to client side and server lag, just like any HUD based damage meter, so at times it may not be actually keeping up second to second with the damage you're taking. Melee damage is more or less instantaneous, but ranged damage can at times cause the HUD meter to lag about a second behind. Keep this in mind, if your health is getting low on the meter its probably a good time to run. We're constantly attempting to gain the maximum amount of response time we can out of the system but there are simply things we cannot work around and server lag is one of them. In relatively good conditions though, the HUD should be extremely responsive to damage.
7.) New Buttons: The buttons have changed but still coincide to functions that were on the 3.3 HUD. 
                Red Crosshair: Skills button ((The CCS Main Menu gesture on F2 still works as well))
                Blue World: Bring your web character sheet up in a browser window.
                White X: Close the HUD info panel and just display the meter bars.
                F3 - F5: Self Explanatory, Hotkey keys.
                Clicking ANYWHERE on the meter while the info panel is hidden will expand the HUD to show the info panel.

BUG FIXES:
-Fixed a bug causing the unit to not properly reset when leaving a CCS enabled region and returning. Systems will now reset to combative and active properly when users return to CCS enabled sims without having to detach the Beta unit and re-attach it.
-Optimized scripts for efficiency.

POWER CHANGES:
-Healer class HealMe-2 changed from 15 points of health healed for 5 stamina to 50 points of health healed for 10 points of stamina. The healer HealMe-2 can be gained at level 4, and has a 30 second delay on reuse. This should make healer based classes a bit more able to tend to themselves effectively.
-New Power added at level 8, HealMe-8 is a non healer class power, it costs 50 points of stamina and heals 50 points of damage, this skill has a 60 second delay on reuse and should give non-healing classes the ability to tend to their own wounds more effectively, but will not allow them to over heal themselves during battle. This power was added to superceed the original HealMe-1 skill that all classes get at level 1 and is in response to the greatly increased hitpoints  of classes above level 5.

KNOWN ISSUES:
-At times it appears CCS loses the information for your skills in the menu system. At this time we are unsure what is causing this and we think it is lag related. If this happens to you, simply detach and reattach your CCS unit and it will replace the data. We are working on a fix for this.
-HUD health bar drops off the meter slightly before dissapearing at 0 health. We're working on a fix for this as well.

-Changes in 0.3.3- 
-HUD completely reworked, not only should it react faster, but its also much more compact and takes up less screen real estate. 
           HUD Features:
           -Black Button: Opens bottom panel and closes it.
           -Green Button: Triggers the level up function.
           -Blue Button: Opens your web character sheet in a browser window.
           -Red Button: Opens the skills menu, skills menu can still be accessed using the CCS Main Menu Gesture.
-HP/Stamina recalibrated, on detaching your CCS unit and attaching this one, players above level 1 will see a marked increase in their base HP and stamina, this is to offset the amount of damage melee combat is doing for higher level players.
-Fixes to the animation system should allow for smoother animations even in laggy conditions.
-Registration process reworked, CCS should no longer allow laggy characters to send a NULL_UUID to the server while logging in, thusly ignoring duplicate character records. This will mean that there may be a delay of around 20 seconds while your CCS syncs to the database.
-Armor is now working, Tank Armor - 1 is giving a 3 point damage mitigation, Tank Armor - 3 is giving a 5 point damage mitigation. These values will be under review and adjusted as we watch how they affect live play.
-Buffs are now working as well, damage increases from the buffs in the system will properly increase damage output.
-Poison status effect damage increased to 5 damage per regeneration tick. Values for attacks with poison as their status effect have been adjusted to compensate for this increase in damage.
-Multiple changes for efficiency and system speed.

-Changes 0.3.2-
- Fixed howl sound not working on level up.
- Several minor code optimizations

-Changes in 0.3.1-
- Database wiped, you will have to re-register when this version goes live, barring major disasters, all experience gained from here is for real.
- Feed and Wrack animation sticking fixed.
- Fixed offensive skills not being able to be used more than once.
- Fixed persistant death animation.
- Fixed kick in Melee on back key.
- Leveling system revamped, character sheet removed, leveling is now done via website, when you level you will be given a dialog prompt asking you to open a webpage, access the webpage to increase your statistics and level up.
- added the /9 sheet command, this will also prompt the user to open a website that shows your character sheet.
- Added multiple new powers for levels 1 - 4, more powers on the way.
- Website power and information manual is in the works.
- Added GM reset function, to have your CCS wiped so you can start over, contact a CoLA GM and they will delete your character record so you can re-register. NOTE: ALL EXPERIENCE IS LOST WHEN A CHARACTER RECORD IS DELETED PLEASE DO NOT ASK FOR THIS IF YOU EXPECT TO RETAIN YOUR CHARACTER LEVEL OR EXPERIENCE THROUGH THE RESET BECAUSE IT WILL NOT HAPPEN PERIOD.
- Region Lock re-added to system. This is to lower bandwidth considerations and to ensure people aren't sitting afk in their houses somewhere else leveling up. Experience can ONLY be gained in CoLA, Remembrance and the upcoming Gamora sim in Brithys at this time. We may find a way around this restraint at some point but for now its the only effective way to manage afk grinders and keep database bandwidth at a reasonable level.

Note from Jora:
As we all know, sometimes things just do not work, and this is one of those times. The charater sheet HUD was a bad idea from the beginning. It navigated like crap, took up too much space, and just looked awful. Due to those things, I have moved the level up system outside of secondlife and into a web-based application. It is my hope that this will streamline and ease the leveling up process.

Note from Suz:
The HUD has been completely redesigned and I expect we'll be updating it in the weekend release/push. Its shrunk its screen real estate down to about half what its currently using and has integrated much of its functionality into a smaller, sleeker unit, heres a preview of the new unit in action.
􀀀

-Changes in 0.3-
-Entire system overhauled for expanded game mechanics, read the manual for specific changes and new racial subclass options.
-Added HUD unit
-Added experience point system, experience is gained by time PLAYED in Combative Mode, Experience is NOT gained while your system is logged off, not attached or in non-combative mode. The ratio is 200 points x current level, at level 1 your character will require 200 experience points to level.
-Added three racial subclasses per faction more details on this in the class manual.
-Added several new abilities, with more on the way! All current availible abilities are availible at character creation or level 0, higher level abilities will be added in later updates that will give you the ability to truely expand your characters power.
-Update server enabled! New changes to the actual units and scripting will now be delivered to you when the system is updated.
-CCS now has its own INTERNAL melee combat system. You simply hold down the Left Mouse button anywhere on the screen and then use either the directional keys or WASD to punch. You may still use melee weapons, but CCS allows you to fist fight by default if needed.
