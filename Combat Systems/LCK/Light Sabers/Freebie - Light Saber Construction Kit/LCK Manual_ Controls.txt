NOTE: 
The lightsaber is an active weapon in SL. In a combat sim it can do serious damage to another player if  used to attack with, as well as push them a considerable distance. On non-combat sims, the damage is not present, but the push is. PLEASE USE THE WEAPON RESPONSIBLY!

The owner of this weapon agrees to hold the creator completely free of responsibility for abuse reports generated due to misue or griefing.
